## Introduction

The Open Source Component Searcher is designed to help developers enhance their web applications by finding compatible open-source components. This tool uses vectorization and search algorithms to analyze your existing project and identify the best components available on GitHub that match your requirements.

## Features

- **Project Vectorization**: Vectorizes your existing project repository to understand its structure and dependencies.
- **Query Generation**: Utilizes Upstage to generate potential search queries tailored to your project needs.
- **GitHub Scraping**: Searches GitHub for open-source projects and components that match the generated queries.
- **Vector Storage**: Stores scraped data in a MongoDB Atlas vector store for efficient querying and retrieval.
- **Component Matching**: Queries the vector store to find the most compatible open-source components for your project.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework used for building the web application.
- **LangChain**: For vectorizing your project repository.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: As the vector store for storing and retrieving project vectors.
- **Upstage**: For generating search queries based on your project requirements.
- **GitHub API**: For searching and scraping open-source components.

## Installation

To get started with the Open Source Component Searcher, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open-source-component-searcher.git
   cd open-source-component-searcher
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB Atlas**:

   - Set up a MongoDB Atlas account and create a new cluster.
   - Obtain your MongoDB connection string and update the `.env` file with your credentials.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Vectorize Your Project**: Upload your project repository to the tool to start the vectorization process.
2. **Generate Search Queries**: Specify the features you need (e.g., multi-file uploader), and the tool will generate relevant search queries.
3. **Search GitHub**: The tool will search GitHub using the generated queries and scrape the results.
4. **Store and Query Vectors**: The scraped data will be stored in the MongoDB Atlas vector store.
5. **Find Compatible Components**: Query the vector store to find the most compatible open-source components for your project.
